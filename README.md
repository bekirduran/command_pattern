# Simple Command Pattern Example
### Command pattern turns a request into stand-alone object that containts all information about the request.This transformation lets you pass requests as a method arguments, delay or queue a request’s execution, and support undoable operations.

### Command objects serve as links between various GUI and business logic objects. the GUI object doesn’t need to know what business logic object will receive the request and how it’ll be processed. The GUI object just triggers the command, which handles all the details.
